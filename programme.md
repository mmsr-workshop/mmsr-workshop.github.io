### From action to language through gesture 

**Virginia Volterra and Chiara Bonsignori ISTC, CNR, Rome**

*This talk presents developmental evidence on continuity from action, to gesture to sign and word.  When children use a word, they re-construct in some form the sensory and motor information they experienced with the referent.  The basic formational components and the main depicting strategies observed in studies of adult gesture and sign research are already present in the representational gestures of two-year-old hearing children acquiring spoken language from different cultural and linguistic groups. Representational strategies for depicting information about objects and events make visible different types of embodied practices and suggest a shared cognitive basis, for signed and spoken languages. According to this approach language is seen as a form of action where the aim is always to produce meanings and to this end diverse semiotic resources are mobilized and its multimodal character is equally applicable to the study of spoken and signed language.*
