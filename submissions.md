# Submissions

We solicit papers on multimodal semantic representation, including but not limited to the following topics:
* Semantic frameworks for individual linguistic co-modalities (e.g. gaze, facial expression);
* Formal representation of situated conversation and embodiment, including knowledge graphs designed to represent epistemic state;
* Design, annotation, and corpora of multimodal interaction and meaning representation;
* Challenges (including cross-lingual and cross-cultural) in multimodal representation and/or processing;
* Criteria or frameworks for evaluation of multimodal semantics;
* Challenges in aligning co-modalities in formal representation and/or NLP tasks;
* Design and implementation of neurosymbolic or fusion models for multimodal processing (with a representational component);
* Methods for probing knowledge of multimodal (language and vision) models; 
* Virtual and situated agents that embody multimodal representations of common ground.

Two types of submission are solicited: long papers (8 pages, excluding references and acknowledgments) and short papers (4 pages, excluding references and acknowledgments).  Authors will receive up to an extra page to address reviewer comments for the camera-ready version.  Submissions should use the [ECAI 2024 stylesheet](https://ecai2024.eu/download/ecai-template.zip) and should be **fully anonymized** for double-blind reviewing.

<!--- Accepted papers will be published in the ACL anthology. --->

Like ECAI 2024, MMSR does not have a pre-submission anonymity period, but we ask authors not to publicly advertise any preprints of submitted work during (or right before) the review period.

We strongly encourage students to submit to the workshop and will consider a student session depending on the number of submissions.

<!--- We will be using SoftConf to handle submissions.  **We have extended the submission deadline to March 26!**  Please submit your papers [here](https://www.softconf.com/iwcs2021/MMSR1/)! --->
